A 8051 core based product for monitor and control of environmental parameters like LIGHT,TEMPERATURE and SOIL MOISTURE.

It also gives an option of selecting the crop type whether it is a winter crop or summer crop and then maintains proper conditions depending on that.

Data is regularly displayed on a LOCAL LCD and on a remote PC , where a.txt LOG file is simultaneously created for future reference.


The objective of this project is to design a simple, easy to install, microcontroller-based circuit to monitor and record the values of temperature, soil moisture and sunlight of the natural environment that are continuously modified and controlled in order to optimize them to achieve maximum plant growth and yield. It communicates with the various sensor modules in real-time in order to control the. An integrated Liquid crystal display (LCD) is also used for real time display of data acquired from the various sensors and the same data is sent serially to a remote computer where complete data logging takes place.

This makes the proposed system to be an economical, portable and a low maintenance solution for greenhouse applications, especially in rural areas and for small scale agriculturists.
